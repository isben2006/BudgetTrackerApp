# BudgetTrackerApp
A simple budget tracker application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Python and Tkinter. This app allows users to add, view, and manage their expenses to help track their financial habits.
## Project History
This project started as a console-based budget tracker and has since evolved into a graphical user interface (GUI) version using **Tkinter**. 
- **Version 1.0**: Initial version implemented in the console. Users could add and view expenses through text-based input/output in the terminal. The first version can be found as budget_tracker.py
- **Version 2.0**: Upgraded to a GUI version, allowing users to add, view, and manage their budget through a more user-friendly interface built with Tkinter. This version can be found as budget_tracker_gui.py

## Features
- Add expenses.
- Categorize expenses (e.g., food, transportation, entertainment).
- View total and monthly spending.
- Export expense data to a CSV file
- User-friendly GUI with Tkinter.
